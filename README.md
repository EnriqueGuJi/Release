### Challenges Faced

During the development of this game, I encountered several challenges, the most important being the application of logic, since it is one of my weakest areas. Also, I had never programmed in C++ before only in C#, so I had a few weeks to learn the basics on my own. Nonetheless, I approached the challenge with determination, drawing on my previous experience with C#.

### Experience and Reflection

Despite the challenges, I had a very positive experience working on this project. I thoroughly enjoyed creating the game map, the logic, the environment, and the immersive elements. It was an opportunity to explore new concepts, expand my programming skills, and delve into text-based game development in an unfamiliar language. The process was challenging and rewarding.

Overall, I am proud of the outcome and grateful for the opportunity to tackle this project. It was a valuable learning experience that has further ignited my passion for programming and game development.
