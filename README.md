### Challenges Faced

During the development of this game, I encountered several challenges, with the most significant one being the application of logic, as it is one of my weaker areas. However, I approached it with determination and perseverance, leveraging my experience with C# and spending weeks watching videos and practicing C++ before starting this test. 

### Experience and Reflection

Despite the challenges, I had an incredibly positive experience working on this project. I thoroughly enjoyed creating the game's map, logic, environment, and immersive elements. It was an opportunity for me to explore new concepts, expand my programming skills, and embrace the adventure of developing a text-based game in a language I was not familiar with. 

Overall, I am proud of the outcome and grateful for the opportunity to tackle this project.
